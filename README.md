#Overview
MyToken is a simple smart contract written in Solidity that implements a basic token with minting and burning functionalities. The contract is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how to create, mint, and burn tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Contract: MyToken
Public Variables
name: The name of the token, set to "lakshyaraj".
symbol: The symbol of the token, set to "IGN".
totalSupply: The total supply of the token, initialized to 0.
Mappings
balances: A mapping from addresses to their respective token balances.
Functions
mint

function mint(address _minter, uint _value) public {
    totalSupply += _value;
    balances[_minter] += _value;
}
The mint function allows for the creation of new tokens. It increases the total supply of the token and updates the balance of the specified _minter address.

burn
solidity
Copy code
function burn(address _burnAdrress, uint _value) public {
    if (balances[_burnAdrress] >= _value) {
        balances[_burnAdrress] -= _value;
        totalSupply -= _value;
    }
}
The burn function allows for the destruction of tokens. It decreases the total supply of the token and updates the balance of the specified _burnAdrress address, but only if the address has enough tokens to burn.

Usage
To interact with this contract, deploy it on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain and call its functions as needed:

Minting Tokens: Call the mint function with the address to receive the tokens and the amount of tokens to mint.
Burning Tokens: Call the burn function with the address to burn tokens from and the amount of tokens to burn.
Example
solidity
Copy code
MyToken token = new MyToken();

// Mint 100 tokens to address 0x123...
token.mint(0x123..., 100);

// Burn 50 tokens from address 0x123...
token.burn(0x123..., 50);
#Conclusion
MyToken is a straightforward Solidity contract that demonstrates the basic concepts of token creation, minting, and burning. It serves as a starting point for more complex token implementations.
